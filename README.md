# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This is a fullstack web app which is user friendy as it allows user to input the required fields and get the prediction whether the card is legitimate or fraud.
My model is trained on a large datset using multiple libraries of machine-learning and is integrated using flask to the frontend. For creating frontend of this project I have used ReactJs.
